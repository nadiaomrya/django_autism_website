django autism screener for infants and toddlers
This was created as my capstone project at WGU. The requirements were to create a data product that uses a machine learning algorithm to make a classification or prediction
based on a publicly available dataset. This project uses a Kaggle dataset consisting of 1K+ sets of responses to the Q-Chat-10, an autism screener for infants and toddlers.
A Random Forest classifier from sklearn makes the decision after the user completes the questionnaire on the main page. 
If the decision is that the child is autistic, the user is advised to seek medical evaluation for the child. 
This application also has an admin site where the questions can be changed and users can be added.
